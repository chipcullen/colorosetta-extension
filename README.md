# ColoRosetta - the extension

This VS Code extension brings the one-to-many color translations of https://colorosetta.com/ to your editor!

## Features

- Translates selected text into 7 color formats: Hex (6), Hex (8), RGB, RGBa, HSL, HSLa and Named Colors
- Can translate directly to each of those color formats. If there is no matching named color, you get a warning instead.
- Note: if translating from a color space with an alpha channel (e.g. rgba) to one without an alpha channel (e.g. Hex 6), the translated color assumes a `#ffffff` background
